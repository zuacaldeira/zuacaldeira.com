      <h2>The Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in Lisbon, Portugal, where I studied Computer Science and Informatics
        Engineering at the University of Lisbon. Under the supervision of
        <strong>Vasco T. Vasconcelos</strong>, I explored the world of
        <strong>Session Types</strong> — a type discipline for concurrent and distributed systems
        that guarantees communication safety by construction.
      </p>

      <p>
        My research was presented at <strong>POPL</strong>, one of the premier venues in
        programming language theory. This experience shaped how I think about software:
        types as specifications, programs as proofs, correctness by design.
      </p>

      <h2>Berlin Chapter</h2>
      <p>
        In Berlin, I combined my software engineering background with a new calling:
        <strong>early childhood education</strong>. I'm currently training as an
        <em>Erzieher</em> (state-recognized educator) at the
        <strong>Freie Fachschule Berlin</strong>, while building software for the
        bilingual Portuguese-German kindergarten <strong>Kita Casa Azul</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the technical side, I work with <strong>Angular</strong> and
        <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, building everything from the
        <strong>Casa Azul Website</strong> to the internal
        <strong>Dienstplan</strong> (shift planning) application. I also developed the
        web presence for the <strong>Embassy of Angola in Berlin</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an amateur runner, training through Berlin's seasons. From the
        Silvesterlauf to the Berlin Marathon, running keeps me grounded and gives
        structure to everything else.
